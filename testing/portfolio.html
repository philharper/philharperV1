				<h3>C++</h3>
				<p>
					C++ was the first programming language I learnt at University. I had never coded before apart from some very 
					simple Visual Basic that I did in my ICT A-Level at 6th Form. I picked up the code very quickly and enjoyed
					creating programs in Visual Studio.
				</p>
				<h3>Java</h3>
				<p>
					I started to learn Java during my second year at University. I have readily picked up Java skills and am 
					enjoying developing these as the course progresses. I hope to one day use my Java skills to 
					create innovative applications for millions of people to use and enjoy.
				</p>
				<h3>SQL</h3>
				<p>
					Databases are the core part of many programs and websites and so it is important to know how to set up and maintain
					a database. I started learning SQL during my first year at University and learnt iSQL with Oracle databases. In my second 
					year I progressed to working with web based databases such as MySQL.
				</p>
				<h3>HTML</h3>
				<p>
					Learning HTML has been a very enjoyable part of my degree. I enjoy how quickly things take shape and how 
					creative I can be when designing and coding a website. I started learning HTML in my first year at University
					and I now find it very easy to create pages exactly how I want them. I can quickly pick up new skills and
					techniques to use in my HTML code to make it look as good as possible!
				</p>
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>
				<p>
					Learning JavaScript came like second nature to me as I learnt late on in my first year at University and was 
					already confident in C++. Even though they are different languages I found it easy to work between the two and
					figure out the similarities. Having learnt JavaScript I now know how to create functional websites that can
					interact with the user.
				</p>
				<h3>PHP</h3>
				<p>
					PHP has been the main focus of my web design unit at University in my second year and has enabled me to
					create websites that work with a database and can interact with the server. The first PHP based website I created
					was a Wiki system that had users who could add places of interest, write reviews and rate the places of interest.
					I look forward to developing my first ever website for a real client and use all the skills I have learnt at University.
