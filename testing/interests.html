						<h3>Motorcycling</h3>

					</div>
					<p style='float: right; width: 75%; overflow: auto;'>
						I have been riding motorcycles since the age of 16. My first bike, a Yamaha Jog-R was only a moped but it was my first taste of freedom
						and independence. When I turned 17 I got my first real bike (a Suzuki EN125-2A). My dad taught me how to ride with gears and within a 
						few hours I was riding around the open roads of Cornwall. I took my motorcycle test 3 months after turning 17 and passed first time. 
						After working to save up enough money I was able to get rid of my 125 and buy myself a Suzuki Bandit 600. Riding my Bandit is one of 
						the most enjoyable things I have ever done in my life so far.

						<h3>Apple</h3>

					</div>
					<p style='float: right; width: 75%; overflow: auto;'>
						In my opinion Apple computers are incredibly well designed and amazing to use. I do all my coding on my MacBook Pro as I love the 
						speed at which it works and the ease it runs multiple programs without any problems. I have always liked Apple products but it was 
						not until I got to University that I was able to afford my MacBook.<br/> Getting my first Apple product then set off a buying spree 
						as in the next year I had also bought myself an iPhone and an iPad. I love the way Apple products work and I can see myself using them 
						long into the future. This however does not mean I cannot use Windows computers, I am still very competent in using Windows and 
						Linux based machines.

						<h3>Swimming</h3>
						<img class="image" src="images/swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming in the sea"/>
					</div>
					<p style='float: right; width: 75%; height: auto;'>
						I enjoy swimming and setting myself a challenge. In August 2012 I took on the Big Swim in my home County, Cornwall. This was a 1 mile 
						open water swim around the coast of Cornwall from Port Gaverne to Port Issac. I had to train very hard in the weeks prior to the swim 
						to get my fitness up, but it all paid off after I completed the swim with two of my friends in 35 minutes. The sea was rough and it was
						very hard swimming against the current but it was a brilliant experience and I cannot wait to take it on again in 2013!<br/>
						I still regularly swim at my local swimming pool to keep up my fitness and because I really enjoy swimming.

						<h3>Scouting</h3>
						<img class="image" src="images/Scoutlogo.jpg" alt="Scouts logo"/>
					</div>
					<p style='float: right; width: 75%; height: auto;'>
						I have been in the Scouting movement since I was 5 years old, moving up through Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorers and then becoming a 
						leader. I am currently in training to be a fully qualified leader and look forward to becoming a volunteering leader when I graduate 
						from University.<br/>
						Being part of the Scouts has taught me many useful skills, I know that if it was not for the skills learnt through Scouting that I would
						not be the person I am today. I have also completed my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh award while I was a Scout. This was a big achievement of
						mine at the time and I enjoyed the challenges it set me.
