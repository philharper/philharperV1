<h1>Lockly - Questionnaire</h1>
<h2>Thank you for taking your time to complete this questionnaire for me. Please can you read this quick introduction to my project so you can fill out the questionnaire properly.</h2>
<h2>I am creating a mobile application that adds/removes the passcode lock on your mobile phone depending on your location. For example, when you are home it's unlikely you really want your passcode on and it's annoying having to unlock it every time you want to use your phone. With this app the passcode will automatically disable when you arrive in one of your safe zones that you have set your self.</h2>
